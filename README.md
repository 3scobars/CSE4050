# CSE4050 
This repo is going to follow all the progress I'll be making in my CSE4050 Web Applications course.
There is going to be a total of 10 assigmnets that I must complete this semester which are: Git, HTML, CSS, 
  Javascript, JSON, Firebase Hosting, Firebase Authentication, Cloud Firestore, Web App 1, and Web App 2.
There will be a total of 8 progress reports that I will be submitting throughout the semester and this repo
  will be getting updated with every progress report. I will be trying to have my commits follow along with 
  every assigment that I will be doing so it is easier to comprehend and go back to see how the code has developed 
  along the way.
